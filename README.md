Complexity assessment using New Relic 

Use: python3 ./complexity.py
Ensure you have a file called params.py present containing API_KEY, TARGET_ACCOUNT_NAME, INSERT_API_KEY (not in repo for security)

the script will create output of complexityOutput.json and in the terminal window, the command line you should execute to upload the results to New Relic.
